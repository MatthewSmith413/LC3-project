LC3 is a computer with 16 opcodes. I used them to make an os and a few programs that run in the os.

The os handles drawing to the screen, allocating memory, interfacing with the terminal, and a few mathematical functions.
memory allocation is stack based.

The maze program draws a purple maze with a white background (although it does it by drawing a purple rectangle then drawing white paths over it).

CGOL draws conway's game of life.
